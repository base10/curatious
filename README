Curatious
===========
Ê
Curatious is a small Rails application that assists me with curating links
on various topics on my site.

Often, there's a topic I come to understand over time, and that understanding is enhanced by the links I read. I want an easy way to share those links, in a directed fashion, that's a bit different than blogging. Curatious is my crack at nut.
